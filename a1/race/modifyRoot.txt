5) As hacker, explain how hacker exploits /questions/race/race
   so that they modify the root only readable and writable file /etc/passwd2

   Hacker runs race, race requests an input,
   Hacker can then symlink permitted to any root only files and overwrite them with the input passed input.
   Due to race condition between "facces" and "fopen".

How to do it: 
    1. As hacker:
        a. run race_old, dont give it input yet
        b. on another shell, link the permitted file with any root read and writeable only file
        c. go back to race_old shell and give it input.
        d. the root read and writeable only file should be overwritten
