1. tcpclientA.pl feeds the server, strings of size 16 gradually increasing until a crash
then prints how many 16 lined strings were required.

2. tcpclientB.pl feeds the server, a shellcode of noops + shellcode + an address of size 65 * 16 
it should require 1 input that gets ignored then you can start inserting command line input 
as if this is a shell, and you are root.

3. tcpclientC.pl passes %x and others as argument gradually increase and we can see how 
addresses behave due to incorrect way of using printf in palindrome_bad.can

4. fix can be found in palindrome.c 
   a. modify the code such get getchar will loop at most 1024 times and on the last iteration set last index (1024) to be the null terminator.
   b. fix printf to use printf("%s", var) instead of just printf(s)
