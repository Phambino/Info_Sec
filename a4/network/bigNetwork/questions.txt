NOTE: For this question it is not necessary to implement the 
described network using VMWare. This question can be done
completely 'on paper'. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your organizations network diagram is in Diagram1.jpg.

Your ISP has given you a single public IP address 93.184.216.34
on subnet 93.184.216.*. Firewall1 93.184.216.34 (aka 192.168.10.10)
routes all internet bound traffic out to the ISP gateway 
machine 93.184.216.1.  

To prevent an attackers lateral movement through the organization, you have
taken a layered approach. The 192.168.*.* network is segmented into 
192.168.10.* DMZ as well as a 192.168.11.* LAN. 

See for example: https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/DMZ

You have placed the mail server (192.168.10.25) and webserver (192.168.10.100)
in the DMZ. Complete the route tables below and firewall1.bash, firewall2.bash
as described.

[20 Marks]
Firewall configuration: firewall1.bash and firewall2.bash lists
constraints for the network. Some of the constraints require
rules in one script, some in both, some in neither. Please rules
in scripts as appropriate.

Please label the rules with #(a), #(b), #(c), ...
according to which of the constraints they implement. 
If you place a rule in a section, remove the corresponding comment...

# NO RULE NEEDED HERE                                                                         #(b)

Please see the sample in ../nmap/firewallRestrictive.bash

YOUR SOLUTION GOES IN firewall1.bash, firewall2.bash
