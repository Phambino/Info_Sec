# genrsa: generates an RSA private key with 1024 bits outputs to key.pem
#           - The role of the RSA key is for generate a secure private key for security
# pkey: generates a public key from the private key previously and outputs to pubkey.pem
#           - The role of the public key is for the use for any random user accessability
# req: generates a new cerificate request using the RSA private key and outputs to req.pem
#           - The role is to generate a new CSR using the RSA private key for security to get signed by an already trusted certifcate

# The following files will be created in makeCSR
# makeCSR/key.pem            : Generated RSA private key
# makeCSR/pubkey.pem         : Public key generated from key.pem
# makeCSR/req.pem            : New CSR using the RSA key

openssl genrsa -out key.pem 1024

# The following is not a necessary part of generating a CSR, but it is informative...
openssl pkey -in key.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem

openssl req -new -key key.pem -out req.pem
