		<h1> # FIX OWASP 2013 A2: SESSION FIXATION </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	A Session fixation vulernability is when authentication and session information is not
	implemented correctly therefore allowing attackers to gain access to another user's 
	identity or gain personal information for exploitation.
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	elseif($operation == "logout"){
		unset($_SESSION);
		$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=False;
	}
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
	Seeing that when a user is logged out, if an attacker goes on developer tools and checks the cookie,
	and realizes that the same cookie is being used, the attacker can identify that the page is vulernable.
	Therefore, an attacker can use that same cookie to reload any pages that has been previously logged in
	to obtain data from another user.
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
	This goes under confidentiality as information from another user is being disclosed to 
	unauthorized parties as an attacker can log into a victims account.
</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
Log into a user or anysort for example:
	username=perl, password=perl
	
Then logout of the account
From the URL you should see:
	http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=logout
	
By erasing the operation=logout from the URL and reloading the page, we can see that
the last user that was logged in will still be logged in. Therefore not truely being
logged out.
</xmp>

                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
From:
	unset($_SESSION);
	$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=False;

We change:
	$old = session_id();
	session_regenerate_id();
	unset($old);
	$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=False;
	
	Regenerate session id after logout and delete old one
</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
What session_regenerate_id() does is that it replaces the current session id with a new one
while keeping current session info. When logging out, the session cookie will change therefore
making it so that it act as a new user that as approached the page. The attacker cannot load any
previous information from previously logged in pages because after logout, the page acts as a new user
has logged in.
</xmp>
                        </li>
                </ul>
