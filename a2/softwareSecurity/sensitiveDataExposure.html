		<h1> # FIX OWASP A6: SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
A Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability is when an page or database does not protect very personal/sensitive
data when being stored. This includes passwords, credit card numbers, tax ID's etc. Given that the data is
poorly stored with no protection, an attacker can easily steal this information and commit fraud. Using a 
site that does not use SSL can also cause an attacker to steal a session cookie therefore causing information
being stolen.

			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
Suppose an attacker can potentially see the database and/or has access to runnable code, if an attacker
goes through the table listed above, they can easily steal the passwords and login as a different user going through
their private data.

Similarly, if the attacker has access to the server, then the attacker can call queries from the code to call the database
and extract data from there.

	$query= "SELECT passwd FROM account";
    $result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);
    $result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());

Also if an attacker goes on the page and sees that it is not verified by an SSL, the attacker can monitor network traffic
and steal a user's cookie. Then use that cookie to steal a user's session and access their private information.

</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
This vulnerability goes under Confidentiality as information from the database is being stolen and the attacker
can use that information to access more private user information.
This also goes under authenication since if there is no signed SSL, then an attacker can listen into user traffic
and decrypt any input from a user.
</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
Suppose an attacker has access to database:
	run query "select * from account";
	
You can see the all the account information including passwords and then use that password to login into the page

When accessing a page, you can look at the topleft and see the lock symbol next the URL, and see that the page 
is not protected by an SSL and that the site is not secure.
</xmp>

<xmp>
</xmp>
                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
	$salt = "as7io4c923k40";
	hashup($salt);
	function hashup($salt) {
		$dbconn = pg_connect_db();
		@$q1 = "ALTER TABLE account ADD h varchar(255)";
		@$r = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $q1);
		@$r = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		if ($r != NULL) {
			$query= "SELECT passwd FROM account";
			$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);
			$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
			if($row = pg_fetch_all_columns($result)) {
				foreach($row as $val) {
					$hashpass = md5($salt.$val);
					$q2 = "UPDATE account SET passwd='$hashpass' WHERE passwd='$val'";
					$r2 = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $q2);
					$r2 = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
				}
			}
		}


		@$q3 = "ALTER TABLE fourfoursuser ADD passwd varchar(255)";
		@$r3 = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $q3);
		@$r3 = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		if ($r3 != NULL) {
			$q4= "SELECT password FROM fourfoursuser";
			$r4 = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $q4);
			$r4 = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
			if($row2 = pg_fetch_all_columns($r4)) {
				foreach($row2 as $val2) {
					$hashpass2 = md5($salt.$val2);
					$q5 = "UPDATE fourfoursuser SET passwd='$hashpass2' WHERE password='$val2'";
					$r5 = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $q5);
					$r5 = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
				}
			}
			@$q6 = "ALTER TABLE fourfoursuser DROP COLUMN password";
			@$r6 = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $q6);
			@$r6 = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		}
	}

	
	Write a hashing function that salts and hashes the passwords in the database for account table
	and fourfouruser table.
	
	
	if($operation == "login"){
		$user=$_REQUEST['user'];
		$password=$_REQUEST['password'];
		$password=md5($password);
		
	Checks the hash of the password with the hash of the account table in database to verify user
	
	Use this line to create an Apache self signed certificate for your site and you should be in /etc/ssl/certs/
	when creating this certificate and key:
		openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mysitename.key -out mysitename.crt
		
	Then in /etc/Apache2/httpd.conf:
		SSLEngine on
		SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/mysitename.crt
		SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/certs/mysitename.key
		
	https://www.ssls.com/knowledgebase/how-to-install-an-ssl-certificate-on-apache/ used as reference
		
	Then restart your apache web server to install the self signed certificate
	
</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
Suppose there contains a database that contains passwords unhashed. When a user accesses the page, the
the function hashup() runs immediately and hashes all the passwords in the accounts. And when a user logs in,
the password they submit gets hashed and get compared with the hash of the one in the database and if they match,
then the user logs in. An attacker that has access to the database cannot explicity find out a user's password 
and the attacker that runs queries will also run into the hashed passwords therefore unable to login to another user
and steal their information.

For SSL, generally you would have to pay for an SSL Certificate in order to protect your site, but in our case, we can
use a self signed SSL to weakly protect our site from an attackers that can listen in on user traffic.
