		<h1> # FIX OWASP 2013 A1: SQL Injection, use prepared statements </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	An SQL Injection vulnerability happens when untrusted data is sent to a query 
	and trick the interpreter to execute commands no intended to access data without authorization.
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	if($operation == "login"){
		...
		$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username='$user' AND passwd='$password'";
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		...
	}
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
	On the login page, there is a username box and a passwords box and assuming that an attacker knows a user's username
	Username: bigBoy
	Password: {Unknown from the attacker}
	
	An attacker can submit a query in the passwords box to see if there is any pg_query issues that happen
	Since the query is specifically setting the username and password from the requests, the attacker can
	use that to submit their own query into the password box and cause an unauthorized query that can make the
	password box return true therefore logging into the user without actually putting in the user's password.
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
	This issue goes under Confidentiality as information from the user is now being disclosed to unauthorized parties, 
	and goes under accountability as there are no logs about what has been put into the password and username boxes.
</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
	On the login page, suppose we have a username bigBoy already found, we can put in the passwords box:
		x' or username='bigBoy
		
	When we press login, we can see that we have logged in into the user, Alex.
</xmp>
               <h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>

</xmp>
                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
	############################################################
	$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username='$user' AND passwd='$password'";
	$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);
	$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
	
	is replaced by the code below
	############################################################
	if($operation == "login"){
		...
		$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username=$1 AND passwd=$2";
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array($user, $password));
		...
	}
	
	Instead if directly using the $user and $password in the query, we use placeholder variables for them
	and execute from the array($user, $password)
</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
	Using the placeholder variables $1 and $2, we can fix the query so that when pg_execute happens,
	it will only get the correct username and correct password from the database and matches it with
	the requests from the username box and the passwords box.
</xmp>
                        </li>
                </ul>
