		<h1> # FIX OWASP 2013 A4: INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCES </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	An INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCES vulerability is when a reference is exposed to an internal
	implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key. Without an access control check
	or other protection, attackers can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.
</xmp>	
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	elseif($operation == "deleteExpression"){
		$expressionId = $_REQUEST['expressionId'];
		$accountId=$_REQUEST['accountId'];
		$dbconn = pg_connect_db();
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "DELETE FROM solution WHERE id=$expressionId AND accountId=$accountId");
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
	} elseif($operation == "addExpression"){
		$expression = $_REQUEST['expression'];
		$value=$_REQUEST['value'];
		$accountId=$_REQUEST['accountId'];
		...
	}
	
	The issue lies in the $accountId=$_REQUEST['accountId']; in both add expression and delete expression
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
	Suppose an attacker has infiltrated the page or is already a user. Once an attacker has added their own
	expression and deleted it, they can see that the URL has variables that indicate the userid and the 
	expressionid. 
	
		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId={num1}&accountId={num2}
		
	After adding and deleting multiple of their own expressions, the attacker realizes that the accountid doesn't change
	obviously and the expressionid increments as each expression is being added. Using this information, the attacker can
	modify the URL to and directly change the numbers from the URL. Given the following pattern, when the attacker adds an
	expression and is able to delete the expression through the URL. The attacker now knows that the page is vulnerable.
	The attacker can use the URL to find out that he/she has the power to delete another user's expressions.
	
	Similar to delete, if an attacker knows the format of the URL for adding expression, then the attacker can add
	random expression for another user.
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
This violates Integrity as expressions from an attacker is being changed from storage by an unauthorized party.
</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
When logged in to a user:

	Add an entry
	Then delete the entry that you just added
	
In the URL, you can see:

	http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId={num1}&accountId={num2}
	For example we can use
	http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=23&accountId=10
	
From the URL, we can see the Id of the expression and the id of the account. We can infer that since there are
id's up to 23 and 10, that there must be id's that exists lower, let's say expressionId=6 and accountId=8, then the numbers shown. 
Therefore from the URL, if we change it to be:

	http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=2&accountId=8

By manually putting values into expressionId and accountId and refreshing the page, we can delete another person's entry
indicating that there is a vulernability in Object References.

                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
The line:
	$accountId=$_REQUEST['accountId'];

is changed to:
	$accountId=$_SESSION['accountId'];
	
for both delete and add expression
</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
When we log in, whoever has logged in has their infomation stored in the session cookie.
From the query, the delete requires the expressionId and accountID. By taking the
accountId from the session cookie, we can surely verify the person on the account vs simply
from the request in the URL and match the query correctly in order to delete entries that they
own. Therefore an attacker cannot use the URL to delete/add expressions
</xmp>
