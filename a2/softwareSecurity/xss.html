		<h1> # FIX: XSS: user input/output is not vetted </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	An XSS vulernability is when a application takes data from the page without proper validation
	which allows attackers to launch malicious scripts on the victim's browser which can cause
	redirection to malicious sites or taking over user sessions.
</xmp>
                        </li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	elseif($operation == "addExpression"){
		$expression = $_REQUEST['expression'];
		$value=$_REQUEST['value'];
		$accountId=$_SESSION['accountId'];
		
		$dbconn = pg_connect_db();
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "SELECT * FROM solution WHERE expression='$expression'");
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		if(!($row = pg_fetch_row($result))) {
			$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "insert into solution (value, expression, accountId) values ($value, '$expression', $accountId)");
			$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		} else {
			$g_errors="$expression is already in our database";
		}
	}
	
	The issue lies when $value=$_REQUEST['value']; where the user can add html code and the html code would execute
	because $expression is not being parsed.
</xmp>
                        </li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
	Suppose an attacker has already logged into the server or an attacker is already a user,
	If an attacker adds a bad expression, like:
	
		badbadbad
	
	and the expression goes through, then the attacker can try and submit something like:
	
		<b>badbadbad<\b>
		
	and realize that tags from html can be executed. This means the attacker realizes that
	the page is vulnerable to XSS. Therefore an attacker can submit a malicious input that can
	launch malicious scripts or cause redirection in sites for a victim that logs in.
</xmp>
                        </li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
	This could potentially go under Availiabily issue as if an attacker redirects the user to another
	malicious site, that will interupt access to information.
	
	This also goes under authentication as data/software is no longer genuine as the attacker has
	entered a script as an entry therefore causing issues.
</xmp>
                        </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
	Log into a user for example:
		username=perl password=perl
	
	Add something like:
		<b>BADENTRY<\b>
	
	As you can see, the entry BADENTRY is now bolded since we have not
	validated the input therefore this being vulnerable and exploitable to attackers.
</xmp>

                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
	elseif($operation == "addExpression"){
		$expression = $_REQUEST['expression'];
		$value=$_REQUEST['value'];
		$accountId=$_SESSION['accountId'];
		$whitelisted_char = '/[^4\+\-\*\/\^\(\)sqrtexponia]+/';
		$f = preg_match($whitelisted_char, $expression);
		if($f == 0) {
				$dbconn = pg_connect_db();
				$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "SELECT * FROM solution WHERE expression='$expression'");
				$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
				if(!($row = pg_fetch_row($result))) {
						$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "insert into solution (value, expression, accountId) values ($value, '$expression', $accountId)");
						$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
				} else {
						$g_errors="$expression is already in our database";
				}
		} else {
				$g_errors="Input must contain the following: 4,+,-,*,/,^,(,),sqrt,exponentiation";
		}
		
		Use regex to check valid input before running query to add.
</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
	Before the expression can be submitted into the database, we run through a regex whitelist check through the valid
	characters 4, +, -, *, /, ^, (, ), sqrt, exponentiation:
		
		$whitelisted_char = '/[^4\+\-\*\/\^\(\)sqrtexponia]+/';
		$f = preg_match($whitelisted_char, $expression);
		
	Given our regex, preg_match will return 0 if no match and 1 if match. If we find any invalid input, it will match therefore
	returning 1 therefore give us the error. So an expression with invalid input cannot be added to our expression list
</xmp>
                        </li>
                </ul>
