Once someone broke into my VM and ravaged one of my systems. I couldn't figure out what they did because they deleted my tripwire database. I couldn't believe it. Woz and I worked really hard to find out what the attacker did. We thought we eventually figured out everything they compromised,
but in the end had to completely rebuild the system because somehow, they got back in, even after we removed Bill Gates account!
